<p>Redhill Aviation is a flying school based at <a href="http://www.redhillaerodrome.com/">Redhill Aerodrome</a> in the beautiful Surrey countryside.
</p><p>We provide training to both EASA PPL (Private Pilot's Licence) & LAPL (Light Aircraft Pilot's Licence) level as well as Night, IMC and aerobatic training, together with cross-channel check flights for those wishing to make their first trip overseas.

</p>
<p>We have both full-time and part-time instructors, all of whom have professional pilot qualifications and have worked for many years in aviation.</p>

<p>Redhill aerodrome is a licensed airfield with three runways and full Air Traffic Control. It is open 0900 to 1700 during winter months and 0900 to 1900 during the summer, extensions can also be arranged.</p>

<p>We also offer a full range of air experience flights, ranging from a 30 minute taster flight to a "land-away" experience to enjoy with friends/family. For the really adventurous, we offer aerobatic flights too!<p>
